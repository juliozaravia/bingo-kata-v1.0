ingo is a game of chance played using cards with numbers printed on them, which are marked off of the card as the
caller reads out some manner of random numbers. Play usually ceases once a certain pattern is achieved on a card,
where the winner will shout out "Bingo!" in order to let the caller and the room know that there may be a winner.

There are lots of different variations of Bingo, each with their own specific rules. Classic US Bingo is perhaps the most
well known, where the game is played using a 5x5 grid of numbers between 1 and 75, with a FREE space in the
middle. There is also a UK version of Bingo, which uses a 9x3 grid of spaces containing numbers between 1 and 90, of
which five spaces on each row are filled in.
