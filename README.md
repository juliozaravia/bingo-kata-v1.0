# Bingo Kata

## 1. What is Bingo Kata?

Bingo Kata is a small application built entirely in JavaScript **as part of the technical evaluation of an information technology company**.

## 2. Do you want to know how it is actually played?

Well, Bingo is a game of chance in which each player matches numbers printed in different arrangements on cards with the numbers the game host (caller) draws at random, marking the selected numbers with tiles. When a player finds the selected numbers are arranged on their card in a row, they call out "Bingo!" to alert all participants to a winning card, which prompts the game host (or an associate assisting the host) to examine the card for verification of the win.

## 3. Is there a Live Demo?

**Unfortunately the requirement didn't include a web interface,** the game has been programmed to run entirely on console, but hey! I'll leave some images below so that you are encouraged to play it.

## 4. Code organization.
I've separated the JavaScript code into modules to keep the functions that allow the operations within the app organized. In this way, any visitor can understand the code without problems. The final structure of the project is:
